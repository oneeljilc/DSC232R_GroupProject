# DSC232R: Group Project - Spring 2025

This project contains code developed for the Spring 2025 DSC232R Group Project.
## Milestone 1: The Data
The [“100 Million+ Steam Reviews”](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kieranpoc/steam-reviews/data) dataset contains over 113 million reviews submitted by users of the PC games digital distribution platform, Steam. This platform allows users to purchase, download, and play PC video games, as well as engage in community activities such as leaving reviews/ratings. This dataset contains complete review text as well as rich metadata about the reviews and their authors. This dataset is combined with the ["Steam Games"](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/artermiloff/steam-games-dataset) dataset which contains additional metadata about the games themselves (such as name, release date, price, genre, etc.).
## Milestone 2: Data Exploration & Initial PreProcessing
The “100 Million+ Steam Reviews” dataset is provided as a .zip file (containing a .csv file) and the "Steam Games" dataset is provided as a .csv file. For ease of use, files were downloaded from Kaggle and uploaded to Google Cloud Storage, where they are accessible via a public url. Using `!wget`, the files are pulled from the public urls into the specified directories and the .zip file is extracted using `!unzip`. The next section of code imports the necessary libraries and establishes the spark session. Finally, each file is read into a spark dataframe and pre-processed as described below.
### PreProcessing - Dataset #1: Steam Reviews
On the `reviews_df` spark dataframe, `.printSchema()` is used to explore the features provided for each review and a count of all reviews is taken. There are two columns related to the Chinese gaming market that won't be useful for this analyis so they are removed using `.drop`. Additionally, it is identified that the dataset contains reviews in many different languages. For the purposes of this work, English language text analysis will be performed on the reviews; therefore, the data is filtered to include only the reviews in English and a new count is taken. Next, there are three unique identifier attributes that are vital for the analysis as well as the review itself. Rows with nulls values in any of these columns are dropped and rows with duplicate `recommendationid` values are also dropped. Upon review, many of the columns were imported as strings so the definitions in Kaggle are used to cast the mismatched columns to their appropriate datatypes. A brief analysis of the time related attributes indicated some incorrect dates so any rows containing `timestamp` values older than the launch date of Steam (September 12, 2003) are removed. Finally the processed reviews dataframe is split into two dataframes: one containing all of the metadata (`reviews_df_processed_metadata`) and one containing only the unique identifiers for the review and game plus the review (`reviews_df_processed_reviews`). Future work will include processing the reviews for Natural Language Processing (NLP).
### PreProcessing - Dataset #2: Steam Games
On the `games_df` spark dataframe, `.printSchema()` is used to explore the features provided for each game and a count of all games is taken. For this analysis, we will only be using game metadata that describes the type of game; therefore many columns not relevant are dropped. Additionally, any rows with null values or duplicate values in the unique identifier for the game (e.g., `appid`) are removed. Just like the review dataframe, many of the columns were imported as strings so the definitions in Kaggle are used to cast the mismatched columns to the correct datatypes.
### PreProcessing - Verifying the Compatability of the Datasets
While both of these datasets claim to use Steam's API to generate the data, they come from entirely different Kaggle contributors. We would like to combine the two datasets on the shared unique identifier for a game (`appid`), but a check is needed to verify that the `appid` values in each dataset are the same. Therefore the datasets are joined on `appid` and the `game` column from the reviews dataset is compared to the `name` column from the games dataset for a subset of entries. While there are some small differences in capitalization and exact wording, the subset appears to match and so we can trust that the `appid` columns in each dataset are compatible. For simplification, the `game` column is dropped from the reviews dataframe and only the `name` column from the games dataframe will be used moving forward.
### Data Exploration
An analysis of the processed dataframes shows that there are 49,606,243 reviews spanning 96,042 games, written by 15,314,376 unique reviewers. Additionally, the reviews span a period of time from October 15, 2010 to November 3, 2023. A plot of "Monthly Review Volume Over Time" shows that the majority of reviews are from the last 4 years of this timeframe. A bar plot shows the "Top 10 Most Reviewed Games" of which the #1 most reviewed game, "Counter-Strike 2" has 4x more reviews than the #2 most reviewed game. A bar plot of the "Most Prolific Reviewers" shows that the #1 reviewer has reviewed almost 6,000 games. In the next exploratory plots, the `positive_review` tag (which is a boolean indicating whether or not the review was positive) is used to calculate "Proportion of Positive Reviews" for each game. Games with less than 10,000 reviews are filtered out so as not to skew that data and the "Top 10 Best Games" and "Top 10 Worst Games" are displayed in bar plots. Finally, a plot of the proportions of reviews that were positive and the author's playtime at the time of review are plotted for a subset of 500 games. Interestingly, games with the lowest proportion of positive reviews tend to have lower playtime by the review author at the time of review. This could mean that games are getting "review bombed" by people who haven't even played the game or it could also mean that people don't tend to play a game for very long before giving it a poor review.
