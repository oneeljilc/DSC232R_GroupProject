# DSC232R: Group Project - Spring 2025

This project contains code developed for the Spring 2025 DSC232R Group Project.
## Milestone 1: The Data
The [“100 Million+ Steam Reviews”](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kieranpoc/steam-reviews/data) dataset contains over 113 million reviews submitted by users of the PC games digital distribution platform, Steam. This platform allows users to purchase, download, and play PC video games, as well as engage in community activities such as leaving reviews/ratings. This dataset contains complete review text as well as rich metadata about the reviews and their authors. This dataset is combined with the ["Steam Games"](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/artermiloff/steam-games-dataset) dataset which contains additional metadata about the games themselves (such as name, release date, price, genre, etc.).
## Milestone 2: Data Exploration & Initial PreProcessing
The “100 Million+ Steam Reviews” dataset is provided as a .zip file (containing a .csv file) and the "Steam Games" dataset is provided as a .csv file. For ease of use, files were downloaded from Kaggle and uploaded to Google Cloud Storage, where they are accessible via a public url. Using `!wget`, the files are pulled from the public urls into the specified directories and the .zip file is extracted using `!unzip`. The next section of code imports the necessary libraries and establishes the spark session. Finally, each file is read into a spark dataframe and pre-processed as described below.
### PreProcessing - Dataset #1: Steam Reviews
On the `reviews_df` spark dataframe, `.printSchema()` is used to explore the features provided for each review and a count of all reviews is taken (113,885,601). There are two columns related to the Chinese gaming market that won't be useful for this analyis so they are removed using `.drop`. Additionally, it is identified that the dataset contains reviews in many different languages. For the purposes of this work, English language text analysis will be performed on the reviews; therefore, the data is filtered to include only the reviews in English and a new count is taken (51,544,179). Next, there are three unique identifier attributes that are vital for the analysis as well as the review itself. Rows with nulls values in any of these columns are dropped and rows with duplicate `recommendationid` values are also dropped. Upon review, many of the columns were imported as strings so the definitions in Kaggle are used to cast the mismatched columns to their appropriate datatypes. A brief analysis of the time related attributes indicated some incorrect dates so any rows containing `timestamp` values older than the launch date of Steam (September 12, 2003) are removed. Finally the processed reviews dataframe is split into two dataframes: one containing all of the metadata (`reviews_df_processed_metadata`) and one containing only the unique identifiers for the review and game plus the review (`reviews_df_processed_reviews`). Future work will include processing the reviews for Natural Language Processing (NLP).
